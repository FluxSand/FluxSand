üöÄ **FluxSand** is an **interactive digital hourglass** designed using **real-time embedded systems**. It combines **gyroscope sensing, LED matrix display, and touch interaction** to create a dynamic and visually engaging timekeeping experience. By leveraging advanced sensor fusion and real-time processing, this system responds seamlessly to user actions, providing an immersive interaction.

## **üìå Project Overview**

**FluxSand** utilizes **sensor fusion technology** and **real-time processing** to simulate a physical hourglass in a unique way:

- **Smart Flow Effect**: The LED matrix dynamically displays the movement of sand grains, adapting to device orientation.
- **Multiple Modes**:
  - **Pomodoro Timer Mode**
  - **Weather Clock Mode**
  - **Timing/Countdown Mode**
- **Enhanced Physical Interaction**: Users can flip the device or use touch buttons to control functions like pause, speed adjustment, or reset.
- **Adaptive Brightness**: A light sensor detects ambient light levels and automatically adjusts LED brightness for optimal visibility.
- **Audio Feedback**: The buzzer provides audio cues when the countdown finishes or when switching modes, enhancing user experience.

## **üéØ Key Features**

‚úÖ **Real-time sensor data acquisition**: The MPU-9250 gyroscope & accelerometer detect device orientation to control sand flow direction and speed.  
‚úÖ **High-efficiency LED visual display**: MAX7219 LED matrix presents fluid hourglass effects and weather information.  
‚úÖ **Touch button interaction**: Users can switch between different modes, such as a countdown timer or a weather clock.  
‚úÖ **Smart brightness adjustment**: The light sensor automatically modifies LED brightness based on ambient conditions.  
‚úÖ **Audio feedback**: The buzzer signals key events, such as countdown completion or mode changes.  
‚úÖ **Temperature & air pressure detection**: The AHT20 + BMP280 module measures ambient temperature and air pressure readings for the weather clock mode.
