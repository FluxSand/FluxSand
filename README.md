🚀 **FluxSand** is an **interactive digital hourglass** designed using **real-time embedded systems**. It combines **gyroscope sensing, LED matrix display, and touch interaction** to create a dynamic and visually engaging timekeeping experience. By leveraging advanced sensor fusion and real-time processing, this system responds seamlessly to user actions, providing an immersive interaction.


## **📌 Project Overview**

**FluxSand** utilizes **sensor fusion technology** and **real-time processing** to simulate a physical hourglass in a unique way:

- **Smart Flow Effect**: The LED matrix dynamically displays the movement of sand grains, adapting to device orientation.
- **Multiple Modes**:
  - **Pomodoro Timer Mode**
  - **Weather Clock Mode**
  - **Timing/Countdown Mode**
- **Enhanced Physical Interaction**: Users can flip the device or use touch buttons to control functions like pause, speed adjustment, or reset.
- **Adaptive Brightness**: A light sensor detects ambient light levels and automatically adjusts LED brightness for optimal visibility.
- **Audio Feedback**: The buzzer provides audio cues when the countdown finishes or when switching modes, enhancing user experience.
